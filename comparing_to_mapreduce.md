In this section i would compare the use of docker and streaming using mongodb to mapreduce and rest API using cloud bucket:  

| compare item  | First | Second |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  Twitter API | REST  | Stream  |
|  DB | BigTable, Hbase  | MongoDB  |
|  DB Location | Cloud bucket  | mLab |
|  Map Reduce | Hadoop  | Kubernetes |
|  Results obtained | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
|  Running time for both systems  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
|  Ease of use, the ability to make changes to both systems  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
|  Computing costs in both cases  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
